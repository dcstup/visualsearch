# Privacy Policy for Visual Search

_Last Updated: May 13, 2025_

## Introduction

Visual Search is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how Visual Search ("the extension", "we", "us", or "our") handles information when you use our Chrome extension.

## Information Collection and Use

### What Information We Do Not Collect

The extension does not:

- Collect or store any personal information
- Track your browsing history
- Store your search queries beyond the current session
- Use any analytics or tracking tools
- Share any data with third parties
- Use cookies or local storage except for storing user preferences (such as sidebar width)

### What Information We Do Use (But Not Store)

- **Search Queries**: Your current Google search query is temporarily used only to fetch relevant images from DuckDuckGo. This query is not stored after the current session ends.
- **User Preferences**: The extension stores your preferred sidebar width using Chrome's storage API. This information remains on your device and is not transmitted elsewhere.

## Third-Party Services

The extension interacts with:

1. **Google Search**: The extension operates on Google Search pages to extract your current search query and display the sidebar.
2. **DuckDuckGo**: The extension sends your current search query to DuckDuckGo to fetch relevant images.

Both interactions occur directly from your browser. We do not operate any servers that process or store your data.

## Data Security

Since we do not collect, store, or transmit personal data, there are no data security risks associated with the use of our extension beyond those inherent to your browser.

## Children's Privacy

The extension does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under 13. Since we don't collect personal information from any users, this includes children.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect personal information, there is no personal data to access, modify, or delete. Your use of the extension is entirely private.

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please create an issue in our GitHub repository or contact the extension developer directly.
