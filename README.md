# Visual Searcher

A Chrome extension that enhances Google Search with a customizable sidebar displaying relevant image results.

## Features

- **Real-time Image Results**: Automatically shows relevant images for your Google searches
- **Theme Support**: Adapts to light and dark mode based on browser settings
- **Customizable Sidebar**: Resize the sidebar by dragging the left edge to your preference
- **Memory**: Remembers your preferred sidebar width between sessions
- **Seamless Integration**: Blends naturally with Google's interface
- **Privacy-Focused**: Uses DuckDuckGo as the image source

## How It Works

When you search on Google, Visual Search:

1. Extracts your search query
2. Fetches relevant images from DuckDuckGo
3. Displays them in a clean sidebar next to your Google results
